### üëã Hi there! 

My name is **`Joanna`** .
I used to work in civil engineering industry, but now I'm changing my career to frontend development. 

In Novemeber 2023 I finished mentoring program with [Mateusz Bogolubow](https://devmentor.pl/).
Thanks to it I've built a strong foundation in coding.
I'm excited to learn more. 

You can check out some of my projects below.
